\subsection{Local Fields and Locally Profinite Groups}
We begin by recalling some basic objects from algebraic number thoery. Given a field $F$, a \textbf{discrete valuation} on $F$ is a surjective function $\nu: F\to\ZZ\cup\{\infty\}$ satisfying the three conditions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\nu(xy)=\nu(x)+\nu(y)$ for any $x,y\in F$ 
    \item $\nu(x+y)\geq\min\{\nu(x),\nu(y)\}$ for any $x,y\in F$.
    \item $\nu(x)=\infty$ if and only if $x=0$.
\end{enumerate}

Any discrete valuation $\nu$ induces an absolute value given by the formula 
$$|x|=c^{\nu(x)}$$ 
for any $c\in(0,1)$, and therefore it also induces a topology. We remark that this topology is independent of the choice of $c$. In addition, the absolute value satisfies $|x+y|\leq\max\{|x|,|y|\}$ for any $x,y\in K$. Absolute values with this property are denoted as \textit{non-Archimedean}.

A field $F$ with a an absolute value $|\cdot|$ induced by a discrete valuation $\nu$ is the fraction field of the valuation ring
$$R:=\{x\in F:v(x)\geq 0\}=\{x\in K: |x|\leq1\},$$ 
which contains a unique maximal ideal
$$\pp:=\{x\in F:v(x)> 0\}=\{x\in K: |x|<1\},$$
denoted as the valuation ideal. This ideal is principal, and it is generated by any $\varpi\in K$ with $\nu(\varpi)=1$. Such an element is called a uniformizer of $F$. Finally, the residue field $\kappa$ of $F$ is the quotient $R/\pp$. This motivates the following definition.

\begin{defn}
    A field $F$ is a (non-Archimedean) \textit{local field} if it is complete with respect to a topology induced by a discrete valuation and with finite residue field.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
    When the residue field is finite, it is conventional to write 
    $$|x|=q^{-\nu(x)},$$ 
    where $q=|\kappa|$. From here onwards, we will follow this convention.
\end{rem}

As discussed above, the valuation ring $R$ of a local field $F$ is a local ring with unique principal ideal $\pp$. Furthermore, the ideals 
$$\pp^n=\{x\in F:\nu(x)\geq n\}=\{x\in F: |x|\leq q^{-n}\}=\varpi^n R,\quad n\in\NN$$
are a complete set of ideals of $R$ and also a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of the identity. Under the topology induced by the discrete valuation, the field $F$ (and therefore also $R$) is totally disconnected, and furthermore we also have a topological isomorphism
$$R\longrightarrow\varprojlim_{n\geq 1} R/\pp^n,$$
where the maps implicit in the right hand side are the obvious ones.
In particular, since the residue field is finite, all rings $R/\pp^n$ are finite and induced with the discrete topology. Hence the inverse limit, being a closed subset of the product of compact sets, is a compact set. This shows that $R$, and therefore also any $\pp^n$ for any $n\in\ZZ$ is a compact open subring of $F$. We have therefore shown that $F$ has the important property that any open subset of $F$ contains an open compact subgroup (namely $\pp^n$ for a sufficiently large $n$). 

We also remark that $F$ satisfies the rather special property of being the union of its open compact subgroups, even though $F$ itself is clearly not. This fact has relevant consequences as we may discuss later.

We are now ready to give the main definition of this section.

\begin{defn}
    A topological group $G$ (which we always assume to be Hausdorff) is a \textit{locally profinite group} if every open neighbourhood of the identity contains a compact open subgroup. 
\end{defn}

In this document we will be interested in studying the representation theory of many important groups and rings related to the local field $F$. The notion of a locally profinite group is an abstract one, but it has the great advantage of accomodating many important groups and rings associated to non-Archimedean local fields and their representation theory.

\begin{examples}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In the preceding discussion, we have shown that $F$ is a locally profinite group, where $\pp^n$ for $n\geq1$ is a fundamental system of open compact subgrups.
        \item The multiplicative group $F^{\times}$ is also a locally profinite group, where the congruence unit groups $U_F^n=1+\pp^n$ for $n\geq1$ is a fundamental system of open compact subgroups. We remark that unlike $F$, the group $F^{\times}$ is not the union of its open compact subgroups.
        \item Given $n\geq1$ an integer, the additive group $F^n=F\times\dots\times F$ is also a locally profinite group endowed with the product topology. More generally, the product of locally profinite groups is locally profinite.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

We give some further insight into the terminology used. If $G$ is a locally profinite group, any open subgroup $K$ of $G$ is also a locally profinite group under the subspace topology. Also, if $H$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$, then $G/H$ is also locally profinite. Recall that any profinite group is a locally profinite group and it is compact. Using a topological argument, one can also show that the converse also holds. That is, if $K$ is a compact locally profinite group, then
$$K\longrightarrow\varprojlim K/N$$
is a topological isomorphism where $N$ ranges over the normal open subgroups, and the implicit maps are the obvious ones.
